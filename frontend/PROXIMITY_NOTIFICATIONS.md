# 🔔 Proximity Notifications - Delivery Arrival Alerts

## ✅ Features Implemented

Your delivery tracking app now includes **smart proximity notifications** that alert you with **sound and vibration** when your delivery is approaching!

---

## 🎯 What Was Added

### 1. **Real-Time Distance Tracking**
- Calculates accurate distance between delivery person and your location
- Uses Haversine formula for precise GPS calculations
- Updates distance every 3-10 seconds as delivery guy moves
- Displays distance in console logs for debugging

### 2. **Multi-Level Proximity Alerts** 🚨

The app sends alerts at 4 different distances:

| Distance | Alert Title | Message |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **500m** | 🚚 Delivery Approaching! | Your delivery is 500 meters away and will arrive soon! |
| **200m** | 🎯 Almost There! | Your delivery is only 200 meters away! |
| **100m** | 📍 Very Close! | Your delivery is 100 meters away. Get ready! |
| **50m** | 🎉 Delivery Arrived! | Your delivery person has arrived at your location! |

### 3. **Sound + Vibration Notifications** 🔊

Each alert includes:
- ✅ **Alert Dialog** - Visual popup with emoji and message
- ✅ **Sound** - Notification beep/tone
- ✅ **Vibration Pattern** - 3 vibration pulses (500ms each)
- ✅ **Works in Silent Mode** - Audio plays even if phone is silent
- ✅ **Fallback** - Uses vibration if sound fails

### 4. **Destination Location Support** 📍

Now uses the correct destination:
- Prioritizes `order.destinationLocation` from Firebase
- Falls back to `customerLocation` if needed
- Shows accurate customer delivery location on map
- Calculates distance to actual destination

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow:

```
1. Delivery guy sends location to Firebase (every 3-10 seconds)
        ↓
2. User app receives location update
        ↓
3. Calculate distance to destination
        ↓
4. Check if delivery is within alert threshold
        ↓
5. If threshold reached AND not already notified:
        ↓
   a. Play notification sound
   b. Trigger vibration pattern
   c. Show alert dialog
   d. Mark this distance as notified
        ↓
6. User sees/hears/feels the notification! 🎉
```

### Distance Calculation:

```typescript
// Haversine formula - accurate GPS distance
const R = 6371000; // Earth radius in meters
const distance = calculateDistance(deliveryLocation, destinationLocation);

console.log(`📏 Distance to customer: ${Math.round(distance)}m`);
```

### Notification Logic:

```typescript
// Only notify once per threshold
if (distance <= 500 && distance > 200 && !hasNotified500m) {
  setHasNotified500m(true);  // ✅ Mark as notified
  playNotificationSound();    // 🔊 Play sound
  Alert.alert("🚚 Delivery Approaching!", "...");  // 📱 Show alert
}
```

---

## 🔊 Sound & Vibration Details

### Sound Implementation:

```typescript
// Uses expo-av for audio
await Audio.setAudioModeAsync({
  playsInSilentModeIOS: true,  // ✅ Works even if phone is silent
  staysActiveInBackground: false,
});

// Plays notification beep
const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(
  { uri: 'https://assets.mixkit.co/active_storage/sfx/2869/2869-preview.mp3' },
  { shouldPlay: true, volume: 1.0 }
);
```

### Vibration Pattern:

```typescript
// Pattern: [delay, vibrate, pause, vibrate, pause, vibrate]
Vibration.vibrate([0, 500, 200, 500, 200, 500]);

// Result:
// 🔴━━━━ (500ms vibrate)
// ⚪-- (200ms pause)
// 🔴━━━━ (500ms vibrate)
// ⚪-- (200ms pause)
// 🔴━━━━ (500ms vibrate)
```

### Fallback System:

```
Try to play sound
    ↓
If sound fails → Use vibration only
    ↓
If vibration fails → At least show alert dialog
    ↓
User definitely gets notified! ✅
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management:

```typescript
const [hasNotified500m, setHasNotified500m] = useState(false);
const [hasNotified200m, setHasNotified200m] = useState(false);
const [hasNotified100m, setHasNotified100m] = useState(false);
const [hasNotifiedArrived, setHasNotifiedArrived] = useState(false);
```

**Why separate flags?**
- Prevents duplicate notifications at same distance
- Allows multiple notifications as delivery approaches
- Resets when tracking screen closes
- Simple and reliable

### Firebase Data Structure:

```json
{
  "deliveryOrders": {
    "ORD-706807": {
      "deliveryLocation": {
        "latitude": 8.9899773,
        "longitude": 38.7540014
      },
      "destinationLocation": {
        "lat": 8.9900000,
        "lng": 38.7541000
      },
      "customerLocation": {
        "lat": 8.9900000,
        "lng": 38.7541000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Distance Calculation:

```typescript
const calculateDistance = (from: Location, to: Location): number => {
  const R = 6371000; // Earth radius in meters
  const dLat = (to.lat - from.lat) * Math.PI / 180;
  const dLon = (to.lng - from.lng) * Math.PI / 180;
  
  const a = 
    Math.sin(dLat/2) * Math.sin(dLat/2) +
    Math.cos(from.lat * Math.PI / 180) * 
    Math.cos(to.lat * Math.PI / 180) * 
    Math.sin(dLon/2) * Math.sin(dLon/2);
    
  const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
  const distance = R * c; // Distance in meters
  
  return distance;
};
```

   - ✅ Alert shows "Almost There!"

4. **Approach to 100m**
   - Move delivery guy to ~100m from customer
   - ✅ New notification triggers
   - ✅ Alert shows "Very Close!"

5. **Arrival at 50m**
   - Move delivery guy to within 50m of customer
   - ✅ Final notification triggers
   - ✅ Alert shows "Delivery Arrived!"

6. **No Duplicate Notifications**
   - Stay at same distance
   - ✅ No repeated notifications
   - ✅ Only notifies once per threshold

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Alert Distances:

```typescript
// In checkProximityAndNotify function, modify thresholds:

// Default: 500m, 200m, 100m, 50m
// Custom example: 1000m, 500m, 300m, 100m

if (distance <= 1000 && distance > 500 && !hasNotified1000m) {
  // Your custom notification
}
```

### Change Vibration Pattern:

```typescript
// Current pattern: [0, 500, 200, 500, 200, 500]
// Short pulses: [0, 200, 100, 200, 100, 200]
// Long single: [0, 1000]
// SOS pattern: [0, 200, 200, 200, 200, 600, 200, 200, 200, 600, 200, 200, 200]

Vibration.vibrate([0, 200, 100, 200, 100, 200]); // Your pattern
```

### Change Sound:

```typescript
// Use a different sound URL:
{ uri: 'https://your-sound-url.mp3' }

// Or use a local file:
require('../../assets/sounds/custom-notification.mp3')
```

### Change Alert Messages:

```typescript
Alert.alert(
  "🎉 Your Custom Title!",  // Change emoji and title
  "Your custom message here!",  // Change message
  [{ text: "Got it!", style: "default" }],  // Change button text
  { cancelable: true }
);
```
